# Power-BI-Projects
Here is where my Power BI project lives. Inside, you'll find everything from the initial data preparation; that's the cleaning, transforming, and structuring of the dataset. Then right through to the visual report I developed in Power BI Desktop. And of course, it includes the groundwork for the interactive dashboard, ready for Power BI Service. It's a complete snapshot of the entire analysis workflow.
