# US Police Shooting
This project analyzes data related to recent US police killings, focusing on the topic of racism in America. The dataset includes; 
- demographic details such as name, age, gender, race of individuals involved
- information about each shooting or killing event (such as the date of the incident)
- location the incident took place
- manner of shooting
- whether the individual attacked or had a weapon
- indications of mental illness
- whether the incident was recorded (e.g., police body camera)
- if the suspect attempted to flee
- there is a category column describing the type of weapon used by the suspect.
This project aims to extract insights and analyze patterns surrounding racism and police violence in the US.

## Shootings Dashboard

**KPIs**
- Total Victim Count- 4,897
- Male Victim Count- 4,673
- Female Victim Count- 222
- Total White Victims- 2,476
- Total Black Victims- 1,298   

**Insights**
- We see a total of 4,895 victims. What's immediately noticeable is the huge difference between genders, with 4,673 male victims compared to just 222 female victims.
- When it comes to the weapons involved, guns. Knives are next, but a good distance behind at 708, and then there are quite a few cases where the weapon isn't known.
- For both White and Black victims, young adult and middle-aged males are consistently the most impacted groups. The numbers for males are just overwhelmingly higher across all age categories.   
- The data shows that White individuals make up the largest group of victims at 2,476, with Black individuals being the second largest at 1,298.
- And here's a really important piece of information: nearly a quarter of all victims (23%, or 1,103 individuals) were showing signs of mental illness. That's a significant percentage that stands out.
