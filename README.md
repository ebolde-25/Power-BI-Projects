# Power-BI-Projects
Here is where my Power BI projects lives. Inside, you'll find everything from the initial data preparation; that's the cleaning, transforming, and structuring of the dataset. Then right through to the visual report I developed in Power BI Desktop. And of course, it includes the groundwork for the interactive dashboard, ready for Power BI Service. It's a complete snapshot of the entire analysis workflow.

# US Police Shooting
This project analyzes data related to recent US police killings, focusing on the topic of racism in America. The dataset includes; 
- demographic details such as name, age, gender, race of individuals involved
- information about each shooting or killing event (such as the date of the incident)
- location the incident took place
- manner of shooting
- whether the individual attacked or had a weapon
- indications of mental illness
- whether the incident was recorded (e.g., police body camera)
- if the suspect attempted to flee
- there is a category column describing the type of weapon used by the suspect.
This project aims to extract insights and analyze patterns surrounding racism and police violence in the US.
